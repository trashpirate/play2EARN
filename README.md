> **Play2EARN** is a NFT lottery DApp for the crypto project Hold ($EARN) including smart contracts based on ERC721 and ERC20 standard deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. Hold ($EARN) was created to bring back reflection tokens to Ethereum, just better. The EARN token is a ERC20 token with a new implmentation to provide reflections to users that is more gas efficient and does not have any contract sells like most reflection tokens. $EARN was launched on 10/10/2023. The Play-2-EARN Game includes 1000 pieces of artwork created using Midjourney showing unique flames. There are 5 categories - white (795), blue (100), yellow (80), red (20), and novas (5). 100K $EARN tokens are required to mint a FLAME. Flames give holders access to unique membership opportunities (access to whitelists, events, etc.) and a chance to win prizes. The DApp was deployed on Vercel.

**Directories:**
- backend: smart contracts
- frontend: dapp frontend (nextjs, tailwind)
