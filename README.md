> **Play2EARN** is a NFT lottery DApp for the crypto project Hold ($EARN) including smart contracts based on ERC721 and ERC20 standard deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. Hold ($EARN) was created to bring back reflection tokens to Ethereum, just better. The EARN token is a ERC20 token with a new implmentation to provide reflections to users that is more gas efficient and does not have any contract sells like most reflection tokens. $EARN was launched on 10/10/2023. The Play-2-EARN Game includes 100,000 NFT Cards of 4 different categories - ZERO (50,000), 100K (30,000), 200K (15,000), and 600K (5,000). 100K $EARN tokens are required to draw (mint) a play card. After drawing, players can claim their associated rewards (100K, 200K, and 600K EARN tokens) using their winning cards. The DApp was deployed on Vercel.
